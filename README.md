# Firewall Configuration Task

## Objective

To configure and test basic firewall rules on Linux using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow or block specific network traffic.

---

## Tools Used

- Ubuntu Linux (running on VMware)
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Windows (for capturing and storing screenshots)

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Enabled the Firewall
```bash
sudo ufw enable
Activated UFW to begin managing firewall rules.

### 2. Viewed Current Firewall Rules
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
Checked current active rules in verbose format to understand existing firewall settings.

### 3. Blocked Port 23 (Telnet)
```bash
sudo ufw deny 23
Telnet is outdated and insecure. Blocking it helps prevent unauthorized plaintext access.

### 4. Allowed Port 22 (SSH)
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
Allows secure SSH access, necessary for remote administration.

### 5. Removed the Telnet Block Rule
```bash
sudo ufw delete deny 23
Restored the firewall to its original state by removing the test block rule.
